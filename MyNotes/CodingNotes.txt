Chapter 11:
-------------------------------------------------------

CREATE A NEW PROJECT for your app that will talk to a database, and change into the directory of the project


INSTALL EFCore - for your given database provider
i.e. here it's the package to talk to SQLite
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 3.1.9


CREATE THE (DATABASE) MODEL
This comprises the context class (database class, inherits from DbContext)  and entity classes (table classes indicating relationshsips) 
that make up the model.
Here in ExportDataDifferentSerialization project:
Northwind.db is database
Northwind.cs is the context class for the database.
    Has method OnConfiguring()  - to point to location of database, and setting up database context options
    Has method OnModelCreating() - where EF Core Fluent API used to set up fields in entites as required, string lengths etc, query filters
    It defines the entity classes as properties of DBSets of the entity type  e.g. public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; })
Category.cs and Product.cs are both entity classes  - these relate to their tables. 
    Can use annotation attributes here (as alternative to EF Core fluent API for stating field lengths, rename a column for use in C# code etc)


CREATE THE DATABASE (make sure database provider e.g.SQLite database already installed)
OPTION - use SQL:
Run create table and insert into table commands
Set up database tables and data...for chapter 11 exercise, copied raw sql to create the Northwind database into the folder your console app is in:
 It's here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markjprice/cs8dotnetcore3/master/sql-scripts/Northwind.sql
 I put the .db file in the Chapter 11 folder (parent foler to the console app)

OPTION - use database migrations...
see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli

Set up CRUD in your application
    Create  db.Add() then db.SaveChanges()
    Read    db.Entities
    Update  find the entity to change, then Entity.ColumnName = "new value", then db.SaveChanges()
    Delete  db.Remove() then db.SaveChanges()

    NOTES about data annotations...two types:
// Data Annotation Attributes  (using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;)
//     Key: Key is mainly used to define the primary or composite key on table.
//     ConcurrencyCheck: ConcurrencyCheck annotation allows you to flag one or more properties to be used for concurrency checking in the database when a user edits or deletes an entity.
//     StringLength: StringLength is user to define the length of string allowed in table
//     MinLength: MinLength define the minimum required length of string.
//     MaxLength: MaxLength define the minimum required length of string.
//     Required: The Required annotation will ensure that property has data in it.

// Data Annotation Schema Attributes:   (using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema; )
//     Table: Provides the alternate table name.
//     Column: Used to provide the column name or column schema.
//     Foreign Key: Create a relationship 
//     Index: To defined the clustered/non clustered index.
//     Complex Type: Make the class ascComplex type.
